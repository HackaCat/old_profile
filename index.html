        <div class='greeting'>
            <div class='top'>Hello!</div>

            <div class='middle'>My name is Aisling Krewer, a web developer based in Galway, Ireland.</div>

            <div class='bottom'>
                <div>
                    <p>I graduated with a B(Sc) of Computer Science from NUI Galway, and have worked in a diverse range of workplaces, ranging from small schools to the internet giant, Shopify.
                    JavaScript is my first love, and I've really enjoyed getting to grips with React and TypeScript. That said, I'm not a stranger to working with Python and Java.
                    When it comes to styling I love LESS and SASS for their reusablity and readability, but I'm comfortable in regular CSS!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do consider myself super flexible and have no issues getting up to speed with a new language or technologies during onboarding and in the lead up to a job start. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While we might be recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, if your workplace is still remote - or is offering the possibility of staying remote - I have three years of experience working remotely, with globally distributed teams and a home set up to reflect that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have an interest in web security, the Internet of Things and perfecting the fried chicken sandwich. I'm also a queer woman working on supporting and promoting the LGBTQ+ community!</div> 
                    </p>
